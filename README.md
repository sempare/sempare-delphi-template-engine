## Introduction

Template engines are used often in in the technology where text needs to be customised by substituting variables with values from a data source. Examples where this may take place:
- web sites using template engines (or languages)
- code generation
- mail merge 
- notification messages 

The Sempare Template Engine is small templating engine for [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) (Object Pascal) that allows for templates to be created easily and efficiently by providing a simple and easy to use interface.

Example usage:
```
program Example;
uses
    Sempare.Template;
type
    TInformation = record
        name: string;
        favourite_sport : string;
    end;
begin
    var template := Template.parse('My name is <% name %>. My favourite sport is <% favourite_sport %>.');
    var information : TInformation;
    information.name := 'conrad';
    information.favourite_sport := 'ultimate';
    writeln(Velocity.eval(template, information));	
end.
```

In the example above, you can see that the '<%' start and '%>' end the scripting statement respectively. Within a scripting statement, you can reference variables, assign variables, use conditions, for and while loops, and include other templates.

**NOTE** In examples in this documentation I may use the latest Delphi syntax, e.g. inline variable declarations. This is not backward compatible as they were introduced in Delphi 10.2 and are used to shorten the code/examples being illustrated in the documentation. The codebase will attempt to be as backward compatible as possible.

## Quickstart

[Try the demo](./demo/VelocityDemo/README.md) if you want to dive in quick and play with the template engine.

## Features
- statements
  - if, elif, else statements
  - for and while statements
  - include statement
  - with statement
  - function/method calls
- expressions
  - simple expression evaluation (logical, numerical and string)
  - variable definition
  - functions and methods calls
  - dereference records, classes, arrays, JSON objects and dynamic arrays
  - ternary operator
- safety
  - max run-time protection
- customisation 
  - custom script token replacement
  - add custom functions
  - strip recurring spaces and new lines
- lazy template resolution
- parse time evaluation of expressions/statements
- allow use of custom encoding (UTF-8 with BOM, UTF-8 without BOM, ASCII, etc)
- extensibile RTTI interface to easily dereference classes and interfaces (current customisations for IVelocityVariables, TDictionary, TJsonObject) 

## Objectives

The Sempare Templating Engine is not intended to be a fully featured general purpose programming language such as PHP where the script itself could be a self contained programming language.

Sempare Templating Engine aims to provide just enough functionality to allow you to easily work with the 'view' aspects of a template. Any enhanced functionality required from the scripting environment should be provided by the custom functions written in Pascal.

## Requirements

This should work with most modern versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi). 

Tests currently run using the DUnitX TestFramework.

An attempt has been made not to use the latest features to ease backward compatability.
Although the development was done on Delphi 10.3.3, build and tests have been run on the following versions:
- Delphi XE 8
- Delphi 10.0 Seatle
- Delphi 10.1 Berlin
- Delphi 10.2 Tokyo
- Delphi 10.3.3 Rio
- Delphi 10.4 Sydney
- Delphi 10.4.1 Sydney

There should be no platform specific restrictions.

## Installation: Delphinus-Support

The Sempare Template Engine for Delphi is available via the [Delphinus](https://github.com/Memnarch/Delphinus) package manager.

### Using the Sempare Templating Engine in your Delphi project

Open __Sempare.Template.Engine.Group.groupproj__ which will include:

- __Sempare.Template.Pkg.dproj__

  The core velocity project. (runtime)
     
- __Sempare.Template.Tester.dproj__

   80+ unit tests

   The velocity real-time demo.   

## Feedback

You can raise issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/sempare/sempare.template) and they will be addressed based on priority.

Most features have some basic tests in place. If a bug is been discovered, please include a basic test/scenario replicating the issue if possible as this will ease the investigation process.
